Hi, I am a young front-end developer at the beginning of my great journey. I finished the TeachMeSkills course in August 2019.

Unfortunately, I have no experience in this field yet. But I am very eager to get it ! Now I am engaged in skills development. Before that I worked as a bartender.

Briefly about me: I leave with my head in what I am interested, very positive and rarely discouraged :)

Skills I learned/studied: HTML, CSS, Basic JS, Git/GitHub. Secondary education: economist. Graduated from TeachMeSkills front-end developer courses.

English Level A2.
